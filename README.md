# OOP
Object Oriented Programming first year course, including final project and assignments.  
Assignments details were given here: https://github.com/ariecattan/biuoop2021/wiki.  
We used universty lib called biuoop-1.4.jar and it is requires for compiling some of the assignments.  
There are build.xml files in each assignment for Apache Ant, which used for compiling and building each project.  

# Assignment 1
This was first assignment for the coruse, and we mainly deal with how to read input from console, and work with it in code.  

# Assignment 2,3,5,6 - Arkanoid (Final Project)
![Arkanoid Demo Video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38776931/136932387-9a0b1080-5acd-48df-9ee5-f8a3c20f8241.gif)


In those assignments we were building our main project which was Arkanoid (video game where you break blocks with a ball and paddle).  
We were using university given libary, and made all the systems needs for running the game such:  
- Collision system and simple physics system for balls, and blocks.
- Movable Paddle which can interact with the ball, and moved by user input using Keyboard.
- Render the blocks, paddle and ball on screen.
- Destory blocks when collide with the ball
- Keeping track on score, lifes and blocks left at the level.
- Multiple levels support, with scenes in between showing counting down, final score or game over screen.

# Assignment 4
In this assignment, We created logical expressions system, which we can create logic expressions, convert them to NAND/NOR only expressions, and test them to get result from expressions.  

# Assignment 7
In this assignment, We were given a database of files including paragrams.  
We were request to find relations between words, using common sentences structures.  
We used regex to build sentence schemes, and search the files for them.  
The code is split to two programs, one creates the database and save it, another is loading the database and run over it to discover Hypernyms and their relations.   
For compiling and running this project, you will need to download the database from here : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11aVnX9r-k5iy2GafZd-o5lBBgeNRuFDN (NOTICE: need few GB free to download and unzip it).
